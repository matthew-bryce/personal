    <h2>Welcome to my personal website</h2>
    <div> 
        <p>I am a tech enthusiast and aspiring developer with a long term goal of 
            creating and releasing a successful indie game. This page will serve, 
            for the time being, as a blog/journal of my progress.<br><br>
            I will be updating this page in the coming weeks with projects, art, and 
            music. The formatting of this webpage will also be updated over time to 
            have a more modern aesthetic and be more in line with todays standards.</p>
